// The renders a streaming answer asks for, coalesced.
//
// A token event used to append a character and then re-render the whole
// answer: the full markdown parse, again, per token.  A thousand-token
// answer was therefore parsed a thousand times, and the cost of the last
// parse was paid a thousand times over by the parses before it.
//
// The fix is not a faster renderer — it is asking for *renders*, not
// tokens: every token mutates the message's content synchronously, and a
// single render is scheduled at the end of the frame batch.  The render
// reads whatever the content is *then*, so the last token wins, and the
// reader sees the answer grow in steps the eye cannot split from the
// token stream.
//
// Pure scheduling logic: the caller supplies the scheduler, so the test
// runs under plain node and the component runs it on `setTimeout`.
// (Deliberately not `requestAnimationFrame`: a scheduler bounded by the
// display's refresh rate still re-renders every frame's worth of cost on
// a long answer, and the eye does not need 60 markdown parses a second.)
