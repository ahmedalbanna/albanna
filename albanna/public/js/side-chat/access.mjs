// The chat access decision, shared by the global bundles.
//
// The launcher asks the server whether the widget should exist at all,
// and the answer arrives asynchronously.  The other global bundle — the
// "Ask Albanna" button on a form — needs the same answer before it puts
// a button on the screen.
//
// That is the whole reason this module exists.  The two bundles used to
// answer the question separately: the launcher decided, and the button
// assumed.  A user who may not chat was therefore given a button that
// did nothing when it was clicked — the launcher had not mounted, so
// there was nothing for the button to open.
//
// The answer is published once, and the button waits for it:
//
//   * `publishAccess` records the decision and announces it.  It is
//     called with whatever the server said, *including* when the answer
//     is "no" — a silent failure would leave the button waiting for an
//     answer that never comes, which is the same dead button again.
//   * `chatAllowed` is the question the button asks, and it answers "no"
//     until the decision has been published.  "Not yet" and "no" are the
//     same answer for a button: either way there is nothing to offer.
//   * `onAccessDecision` is how the button hears the answer when it
//     arrives after the form has already been drawn.
//
// The environment is passed in rather than read from the global scope, so
// the rule can be tested under plain node, with a window that is a fake.
