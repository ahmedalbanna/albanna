// The live hint's names.
//
// The hint counts the reader's overdue invoices and then says nothing about
// *which* ones.  A number with no names sends the reader back to the list to
// work out what the number meant — and the list is the page they are already
// looking at.
//
// So the hint names them: the documents the reader would recognise at a
// glance, and a count of the ones it left out.
//
// Pure — no `frappe`, no DOM — so it is tested under plain node.

/**
 * The Desk's route to a document.
 *
 * It is the link the Desk's own list view makes, so that a name in the hint
 * opens the same thing a name in the list opens.
 *
 * `frappe.router.slug` lower-cases the DocType and turns its spaces into
 * dashes; the rule is spelled out here so that this module needs nothing but
 * the strings it is given — and so that the link can be checked under plain
 * node, without a Desk around it.
 *
 * @param {string} doctype the DocType, as the Desk names it
 * @param {string} name the document's name
 * @returns {string} the Desk's route

 * with no title is labelled by its name; that is what the reader would see
 * anyway.
 *

 * a panel that cannot be trusted.
