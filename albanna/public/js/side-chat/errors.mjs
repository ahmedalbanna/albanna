// The text a server refusal carries, whatever shape it arrives in.
//
// The unwrapping was written twice — once in the turn's own module and
// once in the composer — and the two copies drifted apart: the
// composer's copy had no test, so a change in the shape a refusal
// arrives in was a change half the panel noticed.  It is here now, and
// it is read by plain node, with no Vue and no Desk.
//
// A refusal reaches the browser in one of three shapes:
//
//   - a rejected request, whose body is JSON;
//   - a response body with `_server_messages` in it;
//   - a traceback, which is a list of lines.
//
// The Desk's own envelope is three levels deep: the text is in its
// `message`, the envelopes come as a list, and each envelope has been
// serialised to a string inside the list.  Every level is handled rather
// than assumed.
