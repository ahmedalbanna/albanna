// A conversation as a Markdown file.
//
// The reader may want the thread outside the panel — to paste into a
// ticket, to keep for reference.  The shape is deliberately plain: one
// line per message, the speaker in bold, a blank line between turns.
// Everything the file needs is already in the transcript; nothing is
// fetched and nothing is invented.
//
// The *download* lives in the component — it is DOM work.  What lives
// here is the part worth testing: which messages are sayable, in whose
// voice, and what happens to tool rows.
//
// Pure: no `frappe`, no DOM, so it is tested under plain node.

/**
 * The transcript as one Markdown document.
 *
 * Tool rows (role `tool`) are skipped: they are the plumbing of an
 * answer, and the answer already says what its calls found.  A message
 * with no content still gets its speaker line, so the file shows the
 * shape of the conversation rather than silently dropping turns.
 *
 * @param {Array<{role: string, content: string}>} messages the transcript
 * @param {{reader: string, assistant: string}} speakers how each side is
 *   introduced — already pluralised/translated by the caller
 * @returns {string} the Markdown text
