//
// The Desk is a single-page application, so the page is not a URL — it is
// the current form, the current route, and whatever the user has selected.
// A poll that reads `cur_frm` is wrong twice over: it cannot see a list or
// a report, and `cur_frm` outlives the document it points at.
//
// So the route is the authority — it is the Desk's own statement of what
// is on the screen — and the open document is consulted only for the
// details the route does not carry, and only when it is the document the
// route names.  The route's shape is unchanged: a form is
// "form|<doctype>|<name>" and everything else is the route itself, so a
// conversation scoped by one page is still found after the change.
//
// Everything here is a *description*.  The server re-reads whatever it
// needs and treats the description as untrusted, so a wrong answer here
// costs a slightly less relevant question, never a wrong document.
//
// The selection is captured passively.  The user selected something, and
// that selection is the strongest signal available about what they are
// about to ask.
