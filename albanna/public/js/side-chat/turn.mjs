// The turn transport.
//
// A turn is not a request that returns an answer — it is a request that
// starts a turn, a stream of progress events, and eventually an answer.
// This module owns all three, and hides the difference between the two
// ways progress can arrive.
//
// The socket is the fast path: the user sees tokens as they are produced
// and each tool call as it starts and finishes.  The poll is the guarantee:
// Frappe's request model cannot stream a response, so the worker also parks
// the finished answer in the cache, and this module reads it back until it
// arrives.  A client whose socket died still gets its answer, because the
// poll does not care about the socket.
//
// The poll is also polite about it: one poll in flight at a time, each
// idle poll waiting longer than the last, and the whole thing slowing
// right down while the socket is visibly delivering — a guarantee that is
// never exercised is not a guarantee, but it does not need to be loud.
