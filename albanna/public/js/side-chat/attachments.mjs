// The rules for an attachment, before the bytes leave the browser, and
// the shape an attachment takes on its way.
//
// The rule is here and not in the composer because it *is* a rule, and a
// rule that lives in a component is a rule nobody can test: this file is
// read by plain node, with no Vue and no Desk.  The shape is here for
// the same reason, and because two files use it: the composer builds an
// attachment and the panel reads it.
//
// The list is the server's list, and the server publishes it: the browser
// is told which types the site takes rather than keeping a copy of them.
// A browser that accepts an SVG and a server that refuses it is a reader
// who chose a file, waited for the upload, and was then told the file
// they chose could not be attached.
//
// So this file has no list of its own.  A browser that keeps a copy of
// the server's list is a browser whose copy goes stale the day the
// server's changes, and a stale list is a browser that accepts a file
// the server refuses.
