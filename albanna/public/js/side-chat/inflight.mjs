// The turns that are in flight, remembered across a reload.
//
// A reader who reloads the Desk during a turn loses the turn from the
// screen: the worker is still working, and the answer is parked in the
// cache, but the browser forgot the stream it was waiting for.  So the
// stream is written down — in the session's storage, which a reload
// keeps and a closed tab does not — and the panel picks it up again
// when the page comes back.
//
// The entry is per *turn*, not per panel, and that is the whole point
// of this module: a reader may ask a question in one thread, move to
// another, ask again there, and come back.  Both turns are running, and
// each needs its own address remembered — a single slot would have the
// second turn overwrite the first, and the first turn's completion
// erase the second's address on its way out.
//
// The entry is also per *page*: a turn belongs to the thread of the page
// it was asked on, and re-attaching it on another page would put the
// answer in the wrong thread.
//
// Pure: no `frappe`, no DOM, so it is tested under plain node.
